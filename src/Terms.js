            <h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
            <p>
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure, therefore, that you read them carefully before using the app.
                You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
                and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyrights, database rights,
                and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Volodymyr Husliev.
                <br /><br />
                Volodymyr Husliev is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app
                or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
                what you’re paying for.
                <br /><br />
                The app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our services. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access
                to the app secure. Therefore, we recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features, and it could mean that the app won’t work properly or at all.
                <br /><br />
                The app uses third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions:
                <ul style={{ textAlign: 'center', listStyle: 'none', padding: 0 }}>
                    <li>Google Play Services</li>
                    <li>AdMob</li>
                    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase</li>
                    <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
                    <li>Unity</li>
                </ul>
                You should be aware that there are certain things that Volodymyr Husliev will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app
                to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Volodymyr Husliev cannot take responsibility
                for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                <br /><br />
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
                As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app or other third-party
                charges. By using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
                territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be
                aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                <br /><br />
                Along the same lines, Volodymyr Husliev cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app. For example, you need to make sure that your device
                stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, Volodymyr Husliev cannot accept responsibility.
                <br /><br />
                With respect to Volodymyr Husliev’s responsibility for your use of the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated
                and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Volodymyr Husliev accepts no liability
                for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                <br /><br />
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS and Android – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems
                we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Volodymyr Husliev does
                not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device.
                However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate its use at
                any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
                terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app and, if needed, delete it from your device.
                <br /><br />
